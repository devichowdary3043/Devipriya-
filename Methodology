Step 1: Set up the Arduino
1.1. Connect the PIR motion sensor to the Arduino. Connect the sensor’s VCC to 5V, GND to GND, and OUT to any digital pin (e.g., Pin 2).
1.2. Connect an optional LED to the Arduino as well. Connect the LED’s anode (longer
leg) to a current-limiting resistor (220-330 ohms) and then to a digital pin (e.g., Pin13). Connect the LED’s cathode (shorter leg) to GND.
Step 2: Arduino Code
Write the Arduino code using the Arduino IDE. This code reads the PIR sensor’s data and
controls the LED based on motion detection.
